Shapley values and axioms
=========================

The **Shapley value** is the classical fair-division solution for cooperative
games. In explainability it underpins SHAP-style feature attributions when
coalition payoffs are aggregated with Shapley weights. This page states the
definition, the four defining axioms, and the uniqueness result from Shapley
(1953).

Definition
----------

For a cooperative game with player set :math:`N`, :math:`|N| = n`, and
characteristic function :math:`v`, the Shapley value :math:`\phi_i(v)` for
player :math:`i \in N` is:

.. math::

   \phi_i(v) = \sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}}
   \frac{|S|!\,(n-|S|-1)!}{n!}
   \bigl(v(S \cup \{i\}) - v(S)\bigr)

Interpretation: imagine players join a coalition in random order, uniformly over
all :math:`n!` permutations. The Shapley value is player :math:`i`'s expected
marginal contribution when joining.

For coalition size :math:`k = |S|` (excluding :math:`i`), the weight is:

.. math::

   w_{\mathrm{Shapley}}(k, n) = \frac{k!\,(n-k-1)!}{n!}

Implemented in :class:`~nlp_shap.estimation.estimands.shapley.ShapleyAggregator`.

The four axioms
---------------

Shapley (1953) characterized :math:`\phi` as the **unique** allocation rule
satisfying four axioms on the space of cooperative games. Let :math:`\phi(v) =
(\phi_1(v), \dots, \phi_n(v))` denote the allocation vector for game :math:`v`.

Efficiency
~~~~~~~~~~

The entire worth of the grand coalition is distributed:

.. math::

   \sum_{i \in N} \phi_i(v) = v(N)

**Explainability reading:** attributions sum to the model utility difference
between the grand coalition and the empty baseline (when :math:`v(\emptyset)` is
the reference). This supports global consistency checks in audit workflows.

Symmetry
~~~~~~~~

If players :math:`i` and :math:`j` make identical marginal contributions in
every coalition — that is,
:math:`v(S \cup \{i\}) = v(S \cup \{j\})` for all
:math:`S \subseteq N \setminus \{i, j\}` — then:

.. math::

   \phi_i(v) = \phi_j(v)

**Explainability reading:** interchangeable tokens (e.g. duplicate padding) receive
equal credit.

Dummy player (null player)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If player :math:`i` never changes the payoff — formally
:math:`v(S \cup \{i\}) = v(S)` for all :math:`S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}` —
then:

.. math::

   \phi_i(v) = 0

**Explainability reading:** tokens that do not affect the scored output receive
zero attribution.

Additivity
~~~~~~~~~~

For two games :math:`v` and :math:`w` on the same player set, define
:math:`(v + w)(S) = v(S) + w(S)`. Then:

.. math::

   \phi_i(v + w) = \phi_i(v) + \phi_i(w)

**Explainability reading:** attributions decompose additively when utilities are
sums of independent scoring components (for example, multi-objective value
functions).

Uniqueness theorem
------------------

**Theorem (Shapley, 1953).** There exists exactly one allocation rule
:math:`\phi` that satisfies efficiency, symmetry, the dummy-player axiom, and
additivity. It is given by the formula above.

This uniqueness result is why SHAP (Lundberg & Lee, 2017) argues for Shapley-based
additive feature attributions under local accuracy and missingness constraints:
within the class of additive explanation models, the Shapley kernel is the unique
choice satisfying a parallel set of desirable properties.

Connection to SHAP in machine learning
--------------------------------------

Lundberg & Lee (2017) cast feature attribution as a cooperative game where
features are players and :math:`v(S)` is the model output (or a transform) when
only feature subset :math:`S` is observed. Under **local accuracy** (attributions
sum to the prediction difference from a baseline) and **missingness** (absent
features do not contribute), the Shapley value yields the SHAP explanation.

Important distinction for ``nlp-shap``:

- **SHAP** names a family of explanation methods tied to Shapley allocations.
- An **estimand** is the quantity your pipeline actually estimates. Monte Carlo
  averaging over sampled coalitions without Shapley weights targets the
  **Banzhaf index**, not the Shapley value — see :doc:`estimands`.

When Shapley values are appropriate
-----------------------------------

Shapley allocations are a strong default when you need:

- **Efficiency** for reconciliation with total model utility
- **Fair treatment** of symmetric players
- **Additive decomposition** across independent utility components
- **Regulatory narratives** that reference the standard game-theoretic fairness
  axioms

They are not always the right estimand when you want **pivotal-player**
(voting-power) interpretations; Banzhaf indices emphasize how often a player
*swings* a coalition from losing to winning. See :doc:`estimands` for when the
two diverge.
